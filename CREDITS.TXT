20 years of silence ... old bbs intro style.  Type One is back with this useless
piece of code.  Started at SOTA 2002 and frozen for 12 years.  Rewritten after 
Evoke 2014.

Lot of fun doing this atari-amiga-vga-dos coding style.  No GPU, No Ghz, No 
Multicore. Just hardware registers programming, interrupts, hardware scroller, 
SNES like hardware sprites, multiple backgrounds.  A good therapy to be happy.

Runs on real GBA/GBA SP/NDS hardware or emulators (VisualBoyAdvance)
